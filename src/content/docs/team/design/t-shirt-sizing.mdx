# T-shirt Sizing for Design Projects

<div class="gradient-panel">
  <p class="text-[17px] leading-7 text-[#1a1f36]">
T-shirt sizing is a project estimation and capacity planning tool that helps you track how much time or effort an initiative will take. It should help in planning timelines for <a href="/docs/team/product/one-pagers">one pagers</a>. To do this, you assign each project or task a t-shirt size—from XS to XL—to represent that project's relative effort. The T-shirt size should be noted in project tracking tools as well.

## Size Definitions

### XS (Extra Small)
- **Type of work:** Small fixes or additions to existing products
- **Design:** 1 designer for 0 → 1 day
- **Engineering:** 1 engineer for less than 1 sprint
- **Research:** Not expected
- **One pager:** Not expected
- **Kickoff:** Not expected

### S (Small)
- **Type of work:** Small, net new feature or sizable change to an existing feature
- **Design:** 1 designer for 1 → 3 days
- **Engineering:** 1 engineer for less than 1 sprint
- **Research:** Internal prototyping
- **One pager:** Expected
- **Kickoff:** Not expected

### M (Medium)
- **Type of work:** New feature or significant change to an existing feature
- **Design:** 1 designer for 3 → 5 days
- **Engineering:** 1 engineer for 1 sprint
- **Research:** User testing, potential user research
- **One pager:** Expected
- **Kickoff:** Expected

### L (Large)
- **Type of work:** Sizable new feature or redo to an existing flow
- **Design:** 1 designer for 5 → 10 days
- **Engineering:** 1 engineer for 1 → 2 sprints
- **Research:** User testing, expected user research
- **One pager:** Expected
- **Kickoff:** Expected

### XL (Extra Large)
- **Type of work:** Significant new feature or redo of several flows
- **Design:** 1 designer for 10 or more days
- **Engineering:** 1 engineer for 2 or more sprints
- **Research:** User testing, expected user research
- **One pager:** Expected
- **Kickoff:** Expected

## Estimation Process

### 1. Project Breakdown
- List key deliverables
- Identify components
- Note dependencies
- Consider constraints

### 2. Size Assessment
- Review complexity
- Check dependencies
- Consider unknowns
- Account for reviews

### 3. Team Discussion
- Share initial sizes
- Discuss differences
- Reach consensus
- Document rationale

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use
- Sprint planning
- Resource allocation
- Roadmap planning
- Capacity planning
- Project proposals
