## Remote Design Sprint

Remote sprints involve much more planning than a typical design sprint as you need to limit the amount of in-person time due to fatigue from video. What I have found that works best is to have a pre-read prior to the sprint as well as an established Miro or Figjam board. Example docs attached below:
