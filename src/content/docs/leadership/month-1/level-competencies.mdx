### How to Make Progress in Your Design Career

- Regular Review: Make it a habit to revisit these competencies and discuss your performance with your manager. Seek feedback and challenge yourself to develop new skills.
- Growth Plan: Collaborate with your manager to create a growth plan outlining specific steps and timeframes for reaching the next milestone.
- Performance Ratings: To achieve an "Exceeds" rating, demonstrate sustained performance at the next level for an entire half. Multiple "Exceeds" ratings generally signal readiness for promotion.
- Promotion Readiness: Operating at approximately 70% of the next level across competencies is typically sufficient for promotion.
